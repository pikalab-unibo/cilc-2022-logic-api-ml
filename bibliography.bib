@book{hebb-organization-of-behavior-1949,
  abstract = {{Donald Hebb pioneered many current themes in
                 behavioural neuroscience. He saw psychology as a
                 biological science, but one in which the organization
                 of behaviour must remain the central concern. Through
                 penetrating theoretical concepts, including the "cell
                 assembly," "phase sequence," and "Hebb synapse," he
                 offered a way to bridge the gap between cells, circuits
                 and behaviour. He saw the brain as a dynamically
                 organized system of multiple distributed parts, with
                 roots that extend into foundations of development and
                 evolutionary heritage. He understood that behaviour, as
                 brain, can be sliced at various levels and that one of
                 our challenges is to bring these levels into both
                 conceptual and empirical register. He could move
                 between theory and fact with an ease that continues to
                 inspire both students and professional investigators.
                 Although facts continue to accumulate at an
                 accelerating rate in both psychology and neuroscience,
                 and although these facts continue to force revision in
                 the details of Hebb's earlier contributions, his
                 overall insistence that we look at behaviour and brain
                 together â within a dynamic, relational and
                 multilayered framework â remains. His work touches
                 upon current studies of population coding, contextual
                 factors in brain representations, synaptic plasticity,
                 developmental construction of brain/behaviour
                 relations, clinical syndromes, deterioration of
                 performance with age and disease, and the formal
                 construction of connectionist models. The collection of
                 papers in this volume represent these and related
                 themes that Hebb inspired. We also acknowledge our
                 appreciation for Don Hebb as teacher, colleague and
                 friend.}},

  abstract = {{Computational properties of use of biological
                 organisms or to the construction of computers can
                 emerge as collective properties of systems having a
                 large number of simple equivalent components (or
                 neurons). The physical meaning of content-addressable
                 memory is described by an appropriate phase space flow
                 of the state of a system. A model of such a system is
                 given, based on aspects of neurobiology but readily
                 adapted to integrated circuits. The collective
                 properties of this model produce a content-addressable
                 memory which correctly yields an entire memory from any
                 subpart of sufficient size. The algorithm for the time
                 evolution of the state of the system is based on
                 asynchronous parallel processing. Additional emergent
                 collective properties include some capacity for
                 generalization, familiarity recognition,
                 categorization, error correction, and time sequence
                 retention. The collective properties are only weakly
                 sensitive to details of the modeling or the failure of
                 individual devices.}},

@article{kohonen-self-organized-formation-1982,
  abstract = {{This work contains a theoretical study and computer
                 simulations of a new self-organizing process. The
                 principal discovery is that in a simple network of
                 adaptive physical elements which receives signals from
                 a primary event space, the signal representations are
                 automatically mapped onto a set of output responses in
                 such a way that the responses acquire the same
                 topological order as that of the primary events. In
                 other words, a principle has been discovered which
                 facilitates the automatic formation of topologically
                 correct maps of features of observable events. The
                 basic self-organizing system is a one- or
                 two-dimensional array of processing units resembling a
                 network of threshold-logic units, and characterized by
                 short-range lateral feedback between neighbouring
                 units. Several types of computer simulations are used
                 to demonstrate the ordering process as well as the
                 conditions under which it fails.}},

often used as black-box optimizers, as practical explanations of their
strengths and weaknesses are hard to come by. This article aims to provide the
reader with intuitions with regard to the behaviour of different algorithms
that will allow her to put them to use. In the course of this overview, we look
at different variants of gradient descent, summarize challenges, introduce the
most common optimization algorithms, review architectures in a parallel and
distributed setting, and investigate additional strategies for optimizing
gradient descent.},
